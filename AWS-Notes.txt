1.Cloud computing:-Is on-demand delivery of IT resources and
    applications through the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

2.Pay on-demand: The aggregated cloud usage from a large number of
    customers results in lower pay-as-you-go prices.
  
    This scale of cloud computing help you to save costs.

3.Deplyment models for cloud computing
  3Types

 * Cloud-based deployment

 Run all parts of the application in the cloud.
 Migrate existing applications to the cloud.
 Design and build new applications in the cloud.

 * On-premises

 Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools.
 Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.
 
* Hybrid deployment

 Connect cloud-based resources to on-premises infrastructure.
 Integrate cloud-based resources with legacy IT applications.

4.Another name for on premises deployment
    Private cloud deployment

5.Benefits of cloud computing

* Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
* Stop guessing capacity
* Benefit from massive economies of scale
* Increase speed and agility
* Go global in minutes:-This means that even if you are located 
   in a different part of the world than your customers, customers
   are able to access your applications with minimal delays. 


            Module-2
        
1. Amazon EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud)
 It provide secure,resizable compute capacity in the cloud as amazon EC2 instance.

2. Amazon EC2 instance types:-Are optimized for different tasks.
  
* General purpose instances:-
  
   variety of workloads, such as:
# application servers
# gaming servers
# backend servers for enterprise applications
# small and medium databases

* Compute optimized instances
* Memory optimized instances
* Accelerated computing instances
* Storage optimized instances

            Quiz Question

Match each description to an Amazon EC2 instance type.

Memory optimized  :-   Ideal for high-performance databases
Storage optimized :-   Suitable for data warehousing applications
General purpose   :-    Balances compute, memory, and networking resources
Compute optimized :-    Offers high-performance processors


3.Amazon EC2 pricing
* On-Demand
* Amazon EC2 Savings Plans
* Reserved Instances
* Spot Instances
* Dedicated Hosts
   

Difference bwt Amazon EC2 saving plan vs Spot Instances
 
     EC2                                                   Spot Instances

* amount of compute usage over                    * Unlike Amazon EC2 Savings Plans,  
  a 1-year or 3-year term.                          Spot Instances do not require contracts 

*  you can reduce your compute                   *  you can reduce your compute costs by up to 
 costs by up to 72% over On-Demand costs.            90% over On-Demand costs.
