   Module 5
1.Instance stores
->  An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for an Amazon EC2 instance.

2.Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
->Is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances. 
 
->If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.

->An EBS snapshot is an incremental backup. This means that the first backup taken of a volume copies all the data. 

3.Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) 
->  Is a service that provides object-level storage.
->  Amazon S3 stores data as objects in buckets.
->  You can upload any type of file to Amazon S3, such as images, videos, text files, and so on. 
->  The maximum file size for an object in Amazon S3 is 5 TB.


a)  S3 Standard
–
Designed for frequently accessed data
Stores data in a minimum of three Availability Zones

 S3 Standard provides high availability for objects.

b)  S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
–
Ideal for infrequently accessed data
Similar to S3 Standard but has a lower storage price and higher retrieval price

 S3 Standard-IA is ideal for data infrequently accessed but requires high availability when needed.

c)  S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
–
Stores data in a single Availability Zone
Has a lower storage price than S3 Standard-IA

 Compared to S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA, which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones,
 S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single Availability Zone.

d)  S3 Intelligent-Tiering
–
Ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns
Requires a small monthly monitoring and automation fee per object

 In the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class, Amazon S3 monitors objects’ access patterns.

e)  S3 Glacier
–
Low-cost storage designed for data archiving
Able to retrieve objects within a few minutes to hours
 
 S3 Glacier is a low-cost storage class that is ideal for data archiving.

f)  S3 Glacier Deep Archive
–
Lowest-cost object storage class ideal for archiving
Able to retrieve objects within 12 hours

 When deciding between Amazon S3 Glacier and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive, 
 consider how quickly you need to retrieve archived objects.

4.Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) 
-> Is a scalable file system used with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.

           *An Amazon EBS
-> volume stores data in a single Availability Zone. 
-> To attach an Amazon EC2 instance to an EBS volume, both the Amazon EC2 instance
   and the EBS volume must reside within the same Availability Zone.

            *Amazon EFS
-> Is a regional service. It stores data in and across multiple Availability Zones. 
-> The duplicate storage enables you to access data concurrently from all the Availability Zones in the Region where a file system is located.
   Additionally, on-premises servers can access Amazon EFS using AWS Direct Connect.

5.Relational databases
-> In a relational database, data is stored in a way that relates it to other pieces of data.

-> Relational databases use structured query language (SQL) to store and query data.

6.Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)
-> Is a service that enables you to run relational databases in the AWS Cloud.
 
7.Amazon RDS database engines
-> Amazon RDS is available on six database engines, which optimize for memory, performance, or input/output (I/O). Supported database engines include:

*Amazon Aurora
*PostgreSQL
*MySQL
*MariaDB
*Oracle Database
*Microsoft SQL Server

****Amazon Aurora
-> Amazon Aurora is an enterprise-class relational database.
-> It is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL relational databases.
-> It is up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases.
-> Three times faster than standard PostgreSQL databases.
-> Amazon Aurora helps to reduce your database costs by reducing unnecessary input/output (I/O) operations.
-> Consider Amazon Aurora if your workloads require high availability. 
-> It replicates six copies of your data across three Availability Zones and continuously backs up your data to Amazon S3.

8.Nonrelational databases are sometimes referred to as “NoSQL databases”.

9.Amazon DynamoDB
-> Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value database service. It delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.

Features
*Serverless:-do not have to provision, patch, or manage servers. 
*Automatic scaling:-DynamoDB automatically scales to adjust for changes in capacity.

10.Amazon Redshift
-> Amazon Redshift is a data warehousing service that you can use for big data analytics.

11.AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)
-> Enables you to migrate relational databases, nonrelational databases, and other types of data stores.

Other use cases for AWS DMS
*Development and test database migrations.
*Database consolidation.
*Continuous replication

12.Additional database services
*Amazon DocumentDB
*Amazon Neptune
*Amazon Quantum Ledger Database (Amazon QLDB)
*Amazon Managed Blockchain
*Amazon ElastiCache
*Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator
